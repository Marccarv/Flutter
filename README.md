# Flutter

### Parking Lot Management


In this project we had the change to collaborate with a fluent programmer who teach us some basic concepts about flutter and gave us some great ideas to implement in our project.
This consists in a mobile application for both "Android" and "IOS" (since Flutter is able to compile to both operative systems) which can manage parking lots in a region.
This app contains the following modules:
- User is able to create an account
- User can add his own car
- User can book the place in a park within a limit  30 min
- Soon as he gets in park a QR Code is generated
- QR Code can be used to manage the time he spend in park


This app is still being developed, if anyone's up to contribute and join us, or learn something about flutter we appreciate.


Best regards,
