# Flutter

This is our project to Flutter introduction (Framework created by Google)

In this project we had the change to collaborate with an experienced programmer who introduced us to Flutter language he also gave us some ideias to implent in our project.
Firstly this project is based on a Parking Lot Management, we thought in creating this application to help people with reservate a place in a park whenever he want, since we used Flutter our code could be converter such as for IOS and Android due Flutter capacity to compile to both operative systems.


This app contains the following modules:
- User can create an account and login
- User can add his own car
- User can access the map and reserve which park he want
- He has a period of 30 minutes to reach the park
- Soon as he gets in park a QR Code is generated
- QR Code is used to control the time he spends in park

* This project still in development, so if you're up to help us we appreciate!

Great Regards,
